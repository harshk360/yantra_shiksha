Organization:
There are two folders. One each for mnist and cifar. Inside each of these are two more folders and two images, one each for the baseline code and one with our optimizations.

For reference:
All code was ran on AWS g2.2xlarge instances with tensorflow 8.0, cudnn 5.0, and cuda 7.5. Use python3 for mnist and python2 for cifar.
